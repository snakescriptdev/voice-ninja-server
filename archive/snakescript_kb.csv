"What exactly is a voice agent, and how does it work?","A voice agent is an AI-powered system designed to interact with users through speech or text, providing assistance, answering questions, or guiding them through tasks. The agent works by processing user input (either spoken or typed) using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, then generating appropriate, human-like responses. It uses speech recognition technology to convert voice input into text and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities to generate spoken responses. Our solution ensures that the voice agent understands complex queries and provides relevant, contextually accurate answers."
